# Machine-Learning-Snake (Created by Austin)
A project that teaches a computer how to play snake using RL4J


To try out this program launch the main method within the Learn.java file. Training usually only takes around 10-15 minutes for it to reach equilibirum around 14-15 apples per life. You can try to change some settings if you want to see if you can improve performance.
You can also use the gui if you want to monitor the scores of the network while it is training.



# Important
* Some times the program crashes right when you launch it this is an issue with RL4J I can't fix it just relaunch the program and it should work. 
* If you're looking to try this with some other sort ofgame you can follow how I did it and just modify it to what you need basically just change the number of inputs you will also probably need to change the number of neurons and possibly the trainer.
